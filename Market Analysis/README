**Market Analysis

This exercise allowed us to find out the current status of the entire generics market that's under our scope (and outside). 
The purpose was to target low-hanging fruits with immediate margin benefits and then establish long-term goals.
The margin benefits are maximized when we capture any market share with our private generics branch.

Two files represent analyzing in-scope and out-of-scope markets.
