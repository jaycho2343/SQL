**Package Size Opportunity Analysis

McKesson sources and distributes drgs in multiple package sizes, and there are cases where customers prefer one over another, 
which means there is a margin opportunity to capture if McKesson is not currently providing certain pack sizes. 

For example, if drug A is available in 10 and 1000 sizes, but if McKesson's private label supplier only provided 10 and customers prefered 1000, there is an opportunity.

This query helps analyze where those cases are and help leadership decide on first targets.
