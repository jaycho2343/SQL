**Performance Tracking

McKesson's private label supplier sets a budget before each fiscal year starts, 
and they needed a tool to track down if they met the expectation in terms of revenue, quantity, and margin.

This tool visualizes the current status as the time progresses within each year and create action points by making them target the items/customers that are behind expectation.
